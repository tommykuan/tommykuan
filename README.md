### Hello there 👋🏻

Welcome to my Github.

This is where I showcase projects that I've done. Most of the repositories here are mini projects that I think is fun when I am bored of Zoom University. Feel free to reach out to me by sending me a message at [my personal website](https://tommykuan.com) or fork any of my projects. I am always learning cool new tech. 🤖
